Poject created by: Filip Tosic 

Date created: November 6, 2022

Purposes of Assignment:
* Create a repository to house the git quiz and assignment
* Upload bash assignment to the repository
* Upload a thorough and descriptive README file
* Upload the git quiz document

# **Bash assignment**
The bash assignment can be found in the repository as assignment1.sh. This assignment was completed as part of the DSI 2022 course. It's purpose was to create a bash script that would take a csv file containing parking infraction data and perform the following tasks:
 * Display a list of all types of parking infractions
 * Display the minimum and maximum fine amounts, as well as the mean fine amount 
 * Select one type of infraction (in this case *STOP - ON BRIDGE*) and create a new CSV file containing only those infractions as well as the fine amounts and locations of those infractions

**Requirements**
* MacOS or a bash emulator for Windows such as Ubuntu
* CSV file containing parking infraction data. This file can either be found in this repository or it can be downloaded from [The City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/parking-tickets/).

**Installation**

MacOS users can run assignment1.sh from the command line. Windows users can download [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) here. The parking data file should be saved to the desktop. 

**Usage**

The bash script can be executed using the following code snippet. The script must receive a CSV file as the first positional parameter in order to execute.

```

./assignment1.sh parking_data.csv

```
 
 # **Git Assignment**
The git assignment can be found in the repository as the git_quiz file. The purpose of this assignment was to answer questions using knowledge learned from the DSI 2022 course. The other component of the assignment was to create this README file as well as upload the first assignment to GitHub.
